Theorem unit_resolution_soundness : forall (f : formula) (c : clause),
  readf (subsumption f) = nilformula \/ readf (resolve_two_unitres (subsumption f) (subsumption f)) = nilformula ->
  logically_entailed f c.
Proof.
  intros f c H.
  destruct H as [H_subsumption | H_resolution].
  - (* Subsumption Case *)
    unfold logically_entailed.
    intros m Hm.
    (* Since f reduces to nilformula, any clause c is vacuously satisfied by any assignment m *)
    destruct c.
    + simpl. apply I. (* Base case: nilclause is always vacuously satisfied *)
    + simpl in H_subsumption. rewrite <- H_subsumption in Hm. apply Hm.
  - (* Resolution Case *)
    (* No action needed for resolution *)
    unfold logically_entailed.
    intros m Hm.
    contradiction.
